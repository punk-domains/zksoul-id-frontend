        zkSoul ID is a groundbreaking concept that introduces the idea of soulbound identities on zkSync.
      </p>

      <h3>Free mint</h3>

      <p>
        The first zkSoul ID for an address is free, but only for IDs that are 5+ characters long. This incentivizes users to 
        adopt zkSoul ID as their primary mode of identification on zkSync.
      </p>

      <h3>ID = Wallet Address</h3>

      <p>
        Using zkSoul ID as a means of identification makes it easier to send and receive tokens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the zkSoul ID is bound to 
        your address, you can send tokens to any zkSoul ID or receive tokens to your zkSoul ID without having to remember the other 
        person's address.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's much easier to remember a zkSoul ID than a crypto address.
      </p>

      <h3>Bound</h3>

      <p>
        Soulbound identity is a non-transferable NFT bound to an address, so the address behind an ID always stays the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        This way, you don't have to worry about sending tokens to the wrong address or losing your ID.
      </p>

      <h3>Web3 Social ID</h3>

      <p>
        The major use case for zkSoul IDs is to use them as usernames in the upcoming Web3 Social world.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is why we are building a decentralized social network called zkChat where zkSoul IDs will be used as usernames.
